- We are successful recruitment agency - 300 clients and 2000 workers; 20 recruiters.
- We started our Tech Path 1.5 years ago, first year we were researching the market.
- Frontend - we are almost there! Team was terrible, told it will be there in 2 weeks, we waited for 3 and then fired them.
- Backend - prodigal engineer still in the company (founder's nephew).
- Design - we did it as a team, no documentation or wireframes, we just told guys what to do.
